# Data Science Portfolio
This repository containing portfolio of all data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and R markdown files.
# Content
 - **Machine learning**
   - [Bicycle Prediction](https://github.com/shrinath305/Bicycle-prediction/blob/master/Bicycle%20prediction.ipynb): A model to determine the extent to which weather and seasonal factors—temperature, precipitation, and daylight hours—affect the volume of bicycle traffic through this corridor utilizing machine learning.
   - Market-Basket-analysis: Mine frequent itemsets, association rules or association hyperedges using the Apriori algorithm. The Apriori    algorithm employs level-wise search for frequent item sets.
   - Supervised Learning(Classification): Testing out several different supervised clssfication algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual has Breast cancer or not.
   - Deep Learning: Photo Recognition using CNNs: Designing and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network that learns to recognize the image.
