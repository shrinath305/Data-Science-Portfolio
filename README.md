# Data Science Portfolio
This repository containing portfolio of all data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and R markdown files.
# Content
 - Machine learning
   Bicycle Prediction: A model to determine the extent to which weather and seasonal factors—temperature, precipitation, and daylight hours—affect the volume of bicycle traffic through this corridor utilizing machine learning.
  Market-Basket-analysis: Mine frequent itemsets, association rules or association hyperedges using the Apriori algorithm. The Apriori    algorithm employs level-wise search for frequent item sets.
  Supervised Learning(Classification): Testing out several different supervised clssfication algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual has Breast cancer or not.
  Reinforcement Learning: Training a Smartcab to Drive: Creating an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that will navigate a Smartcab  through its environment towards a goal.
  Deep Learning: Photo Recognition using CNNs: Designing and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network that learns to recognize the image.
