# Data Science Portfolio
This repository containing portfolio of all data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and R markdown files.
# Content
 - **Machine learning**
   - [Bicycle Prediction](https://github.com/shrinath305/Bicycle-prediction/blob/master/Bicycle%20prediction.ipynb): A model to determine the extent to which weather and seasonal factors—temperature, precipitation, and daylight hours—affect the volume of bicycle traffic through this corridor utilizing machine learning.
   - [Market-Basket](https://github.com/shrinath305/Market-Basket-analysis/blob/master/MBA.html)-analysis: Mine frequent itemsets, association rules or association hyperedges using the Apriori algorithm. The Apriori    algorithm employs level-wise search for frequent item sets.
   - [Supervised Learning(Classification)](https://github.com/shrinath305/Breast-Cancer-or-Not--with-more-than-10-ML-/blob/master/code.html): Testing out several different supervised clssfication algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual has Breast cancer or not.
   - [Deep Learning](https://github.com/shrinath305/Deep-learning): Photo Recognition using CNNs: Designing and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network that learns to recognize the image.
   
Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, R studio, R Markdown

# Natural Language Processing
   - [Yelp review analysis](https://github.com/shrinath305/Yelp--dataset-review-analysis/blob/master/yelp.ipynb): Build model which read alll review and whether the review was good or bad.

   - [Spam message detection](https://github.com/shrinath305/Spam-message-detection/blob/master/Predictive_Final_Project-2.ipynb) : A model to determine whether the upcoming mail is Spam or not.
  
  Tools : NLTK, scikit
  
# Data Analysis and Visualisation
  - [Analysis-on-US-census-data](https://github.com/shrinath305/Analysis-on-US-census-data): Analysis of walkability of suburbs in Melbourne, Victoria and its implications.
[Titanic Dataset](https://github.com/shrinath305/Titanic-code/blob/master/Titanic.ipynb) - Exploratory Analysis: Exploratory Analysis of the passengers onboard RMS Titanic using Pandas and Seaborn visualisations.
Big-mart-sales-Prediction: To predict the sales   based on Purchase history, Store location and many more variables .
[correlation between corruption and development](https://github.com/shrinath305/Visualisation-using-ggplot/blob/master/ggplot2.html): Comparing the corruption index with the UN's Human Development Index (a measure combining health, wealth and education).
[911 Calls](https://github.com/shrinath305/911-calls-capstone-project-Kaggle-/blob/master/911%20Calls%20Data%20Capstone%20Project%20.ipynb) - Exploratory Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis of the 911 calls dataset hosted on Kaggle. Demonstrates extraction of useful features from different variables.

# Micro Projects:
   - [ML with Logistic Regression](https://github.com/shrinath305/WIne-quality/blob/master/Patel_Shrinath_Capstone_Project.ipynb): Using Logistic Regression to predict the quality of wine.
   - [ML with K Nearest Neighbours](: Using KNN to classify instances from a fake dataset into two target classes, while choosing the best value for K using the elbow method.
   - [ML with Decision Trees and Random Forests](https://github.com/shrinath305/Decision-tree-and-random-forest/blob/master/Decision%20tree%20and%20Random%20forest.ipynb): Using Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict whether a lender will pay their loan back. Uses publically available data from LendingClub.com
    - [Movie Recommendations using Recommender Systems](https://github.com/shrinath305/recommneder-system-using-pyspark/blob/master/Recommender%20Systems%20.ipynb): A micro project to build a recommendation system that makes movie recommendations based on user review similarities.
